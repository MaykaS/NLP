# NLP 5 Course Specialization on Coursera

Instructors: [Younes Bensouda Mourri](https://www.coursera.org/instructor/ymourri), [≈Åukasz Kaiser](https://www.coursera.org/instructor/lukaszkaiser), [Eddy Shyu](https://www.coursera.org/instructor/eddy-shyu)

## Introduction

This repo contains all my work for this specialization. 

## My thoughts

As a CS student my goal is to always keep learning.
With time I got interested in the Deep Learning world and decided to dive in.
After I have finished the 5 course specialization in Deep Learning offered by Adnrew Ng I have decided to enrich my knowledge in Natural Language Processing.
