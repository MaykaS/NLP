## Introduction

This repo contains all my work for this specialization. 

## My thoughts

As a CS student my goal is to always keep learning.
With time I got interested in the Deep Learning world and decided to dive in.
After I have finished the 5 course specialization in Deep Learning offered by Adnrew Ng I have decided to enrich my knowledge in Natural Language Processing.
